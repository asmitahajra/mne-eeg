    "##### Data processing was done using MATLAB (The Math- Works, Inc.) and EEGLAB software (Delorme and Makeig 2004).\n",
    "\n",
    "##### The raw EEG data were average referenced and down-sampled from 2048 to 256 Hz.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### A high-pass filter at 2 Hz using a infinite impulse response filter (IIR; transi- tion bandwidth of 0.7 Hz and order of 6) was applied, and the data were then average referenced again.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### The high-pass filter was necessary to obtain high-quality ICA decompo- sitions on some subjects (see below) and, even though it was not necessary for all subjects, we opted to use the same high-pass filter settings for all subjects to ensure that all data were processed uniformly.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Data were then segmented into 10 s-epochs, ranging from −10.05 to −0.05 s prior to the onset of question Q1 in the experience-sampling probe series\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Bad electrodes (0–20 per subject, average of 6 per subject) and bad epochs containing paroxysmal activity were manually removed.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Extended Infomax Independent Component Analysis (ICA) was then used to identify ocu- lar and muscle artifacts (Delorme et al. 2007). ICA com- ponents for eye blink, lateral eye movements and tempo- ral muscle noise were identified and subtracted from the data by the visual inspection of both the component scalp topographies and power spectrum distributions. Between 1 and 5 artifactual components were removed for each sub- ject.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### After artifact rejection, between 21 and 64 clean data epochs (mean of 38.1; SD of 12.6) were included in subse- quent analyses for each subject."
